HTTP is an application layer protocol designed to transfer information between networked devices and runs on top of other layers of the network protocol stack.
It stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, which aims to transfer hypertext data such as HTML, etc.
As you know, the HTTP is used as a standard protocol for Web services.
